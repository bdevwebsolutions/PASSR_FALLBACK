     -- An airdrop of 10K tokens spread over 10 users --
    User 1 has a usageCounter of 11 while the other 9 have a usageCounter of 1.
    The total amount of usages is 20 so for every usage, 500 tokens will be distributed.
    User 1 will receive 11 * 500 tokens while the others receive 1 * 500.
